## Setup VIM for typical dev work

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unicman/dev-tools/master/setup-vim.sh | bash
```

This should install pathogen and useful VIM plugins, syntax files and compilers. It should work for VIM 7.4+ ... best is if you have VIM 8.0+ because some cool plugins like ALE need that version.
