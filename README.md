# dev-tools
Miscellaneous scripts and configurations useful for development and usage.

## Setup VIM for typical dev work

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unicman/dev-tools/master/setup-vim.sh | bash
```

This should install pathogen and useful VIM plugins, syntax files and compilers. It should work for VIM 7.4+ ... best is if you have VIM 8.0+ because some cool plugins like ALE need that version.

NOTE: On Windows you can execute the command using 'Git Bash' shell that comes with GitHub Desktop.

## Setup screen tool (Only for Linux)

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unicman/dev-tools/master/setup-screen.sh | bash
```
